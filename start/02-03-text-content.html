  Description
  Today I’m going to share with you my great great grandmother’s recipe for a baked potato.
  Now, you might be thinking to yourself… “it’s a baked potato, how hard could it be.” But it wasn’t until Easter
  last
  year when I was preparing dinner with my own mother when I realized how much better a plain baked potato could be.
  Whether you realize it or not, many factors contribute to how rich and buttery your baked potatoes taste. And there
  are
  a multitude of toppings that can take you from zero to 100 real quick! Today I’ll share with you my family secrets
  so
  you can wow your own family this holiday season.

  Chives to taste
